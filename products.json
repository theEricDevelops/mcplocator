Peak XV was determined to be the highest peak in the world and was named after the father of Indian geodesy, Sir George Everest. While highest, its exact altitude remained elusive. With cooperation from Nepal and China, and under the direction of veteran cartographers, Dr. Bradford Washburn and Dr. Roger Bilham, the American Everest Expedition 1995 set out to use the most current technology to increase scientific knowledge of the peak. Their work continued with American Everest Expeditions 1996, 1997 and 1998. On May 20, 1998 and May 5, 1999, GPS data was gathered and a new elevation determined--29,035 Feet (8850 meters.)<br> This commemorative is fashioned after the 12\" base which supports the GPS receiver used for scientific measurements on Mount Everest.

The Stairs provided access to the summit of Puʻukeahiakahoe on the Koʻolau ridge and enabled construction of the antenna system that served the Naval Radio Station at Haʻikū. Antennae were strung 7200 feet between ridges across  Haʻikū Valley to support the 200 KW transmitter station that was built in the Valley. As a result, it was possible to transmit critically important, long range, very low frequency (VLF) radio messages to submarines and other ships in Tokyo Bay and the Indian Ocean. The original cedar wood stairs were replaced by metal stairs in 1955 and a major renovation of the Stairs was undertaken in 2002.<span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">There are 3,922 steps to the top of Haʻikū Stairs. Total length is approximately 4000 feet with an average angle of ascent of about 30°.</span><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Climbers are rewarded with awe-inspiring views of the windward and leeward coasts of O‘ahu.

Half Dome is perhaps the most recognized and sought after. Visitors planning a hike to the top are assisted with cables anchored securely in the massive monolith. Even so, the 17 mile round trip is challenging and requires caution, fitness and endurance. Half Dome can be seen throughout eastern Yosemite Valley and from Glacier Point. Alternate names include Frances Peak, Rock of Ages, Tesayac, and To-co-ya.<br> What's in a name? Plenty!

The M &amp; PP RY culminates at the summit of Pikes Peak, America's most famous mountain (elevation 14,110 feet). The average gradient is over 16%; at some points, the M &amp; PP RY rises at a rate of 25% (25 vertical feet in 100 horizontal feet.) Only a rack railway in Switzerland exceeds its length of 8.9 miles. The Manitou &amp; Pikes Peak Railway was organized in the fall of 1888 by Major John Hulbert and Zalmon Simmons, majority stockholder. It was built by a crew of 1,000, six of whom died accidentally or from heart failure.

The clean, dry air and absence of urban light makes the summit ideal for astronomical observations. Because of these advantages, the Maunakea Observatory (the world's largest) has made many break-through discoveries. The public can share the spirit of discovery during star gazing programs, held daily from 6-10 p.m.<br> Climbing Maunakea is primarily long and tedious. The climb is a popular way for mainland Highpointers to combine hiking a state highpoint with a tropical vacation.

Originally named “Faith, Hope and Charity”, the peaks are now known as North Sister, Middle Sister and South Sister.</span> Of the three peaks, North Sister is the oldest in geologic age. Over time it has lost nearly one third of its height due to extensive erosion, causing rock fall; rock fall makes it the most dangerous of the three to climb. Because its last eruption occurred more than 100,000 years ago, it is considered to be an extinct volcano.</div>","variants_count":1,"created_at_site":"2016-10-12T18:34:24.000Z","updated_at_site":"2024-05-02T15:21:10.000Z","published_at_site":"2016-11-08T15:24:00.000Z","instore_product_type":"pin"},{"name":"Old Faithful Geyser Hiking Stick Medallion","handle":"old-faithful-geyser-hiking-stick-medallion","images":[{"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/5982/products/OLDFFhsm.gif?v=1571262414","image_id":102673302,"position":1,"product_id":47548482,"variant_ids":[],"created_at_site":"2011-07-27T19:00:46.000Z","updated_at_site":"2019-10-16T21:46:54.000Z"},{"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/5982/products/Old_Faithful_Rough_Art_170c22ff-245d-4e78-a967-1ab7bc9efa2e.jpg?v=1571262414","image_id":515168933,"position":2,"product_id":47548482,"variant_ids":[],"created_at_site":"2014-02-20T20:48:09.000Z","updated_at_site":"2019-10-16T21:46:54.000Z"}],"vendor":"national parks and monuments","options":[{"name":"Title","values":["Default Title"],"position":1}],"variants":[{"sku":"HM:OLDFFLhm","grams":0,"price":4.2,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"taxable":true,"position":1,"available":true,"created_at":"2024-05-02T15:21:11.061Z","product_id":47548482,"updated_at":"2024-05-02T15:21:11.061Z","variant_id":111567322,"featured_image":null,"created_at_site":"2011-07-27T18:57:16.000Z","updated_at_site":"2024-05-02T15:21:10.000Z","requires_shipping":true}],"max_price":4.2,"min_price":4.2,"bestseller":false,"instore_id":47548482,"description":"<ul class=\"bullets\">\n<li>1-3/4 inch diameter</li>\n<li>3 nails included for mounting</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"interpretivetext\">\n<span>Place Name:</span> Old Faithful Geyser <br><span>Elevation:</span> 7349 ft.<br><span>Coordinates:</span> N44° 27' 38'' W110° 49' 44'' <br><span>Location:</span> Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA <br><span>MarkerSleuth Photo Contributor:</span> No Station Found; Original Artwork <br><span class=\"text\">Geysers!

It's no wonder that for almost a century, it's been the most popular mountain climbing destination in Utah.<br> Centuries ago, the Ute Indians retreated to this canyon to escape the summer heat and hunt the abundant game, before Scottish surveyors and sheepherders converted the snow-laden slopes into a ski recreation area. Indian legends of the mountain, whose horizon looks like a sleeping woman, are preserved today.<br> In 1912, Eugene \"Timp\" Roberts started the popular annual \"Timp Hike\" but was discontinued in 1970 in order to protect the fragile alpine ecosystem.
