Less than a minute long, it sent a 100 MPH, 80 million-ton landslide barreling down one mountainside and 400 feet up another. The quake blocked the Madison River, creating 190-foot-deep Earthquake Lake, dropping the bottom of adjacent Hebgen Lake 20 feet, and burying a campground under 230 feet of rock. Twenty-eight campers died, including 19 never found, and 250 were rescued the next day.
